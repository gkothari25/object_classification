How to classify defect/Healthy parts using computer vision and deep learning.
In this solution I am using transfer learning for classifying the Defect and Healthy parts.

Transfer Learning - Transfer learning is the application of knowledge gained from completing one task to help solve a different, but related, problem. Through transfer learning, methods are developed to transfer knowledge from one or more of these source tasks to improve learning in a related target task.

xception network -
Xception V1 model, with weights pre-trained on ImageNet.
On ImageNet, this model gets to a top-1 validation accuracy of 0.790 and a top-5 validation accuracy of 0.945.
Note that this model only supports the data format 'channels_last' (height, width, channels).
The default input size for this model is 299x299.
